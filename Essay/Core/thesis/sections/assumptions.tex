\begin{itemize}
  \item
    We use one year data in Victoria with data provided by Earth Data to
    represent the general cases in Australia. However, our model to this
    case adapt to arbitrary cases, so it's without losing generality.
  \item
    We assume once the fire is within the detective range of drones, it
    will be found out without delay.
  \item
    We assume the spread rate of fire is stable and at a certain value,
    which is not the case in real world, but one can use the original
    formulae given in the model to simply modify the model.
  \item
    Only 20 years of data is used for machine learning, the error produced
    is within the acceptable range.
  \item
    The terrain situation can be more complicated in real world, we
    idealize mountain and other barriers as parabolic-like object.
