\subsection{Background}

Wildfire spreads rapidly in Australia. In fire season, it's devastating for people's safety and properties. Victoriaâ€™s Country Fire Authority (CFA) uses different means to protect its people. Drones carrying high definition & thermal imaging cameras and telemetry sensors were sent for surveillance and situational awareness (SSA). Drone repeaters, transceivers that automatically rebroadcast signals at higher powers can help connect Emergency Operations Center (EOC) with SSA and front-line employees with VHF/UHF bands.
