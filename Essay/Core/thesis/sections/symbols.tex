	\(dist\) & Distance between two points in Euclidean coordinate system \\
	\(R_e\) & Radius of earth \\
	\(\Delta \varphi _{lat}\) & Thange of latitude \\
	\(\Delta \lambda _{lon}\) & Thange of longitude \\
	\(eps\) & Tf the distance between two points is lower or equal to (eps),
	these points are considered neighbuors. \\
	\(minPoints\) & The minimum number of points to form a dense region. \\
	\(x_0\) & Distance to drone when the fire is recorded in our data \\
	\(x_1\) & Distance to drone when drone detect fire \\
	\(dis_{j,t}\) & The shortest distance of fire location indexed \(j\) to
	the nearest drone at distance \(x\) from the drone \\
	\(r_c\) & The radius of drone in idealized condition. \\
	\(vs_{j,x} \) & The spread rate of fire at the rim of fire area indexed
	\(j\) at distance \(x\) from the drone  \\
	\(p_{j,x}\) & The probability for drones to detect rim of fire location
	\(j\) at distance \(x\) from the drone \\
	\(v\) & Stable spread rate which is assumed to simply the model \\
	\(WCL\) & Weighted coverage loss : describing the loss the weighted area
	for a deployment strategy \\
	\(r_o\) & Outer-radius of drone, meaning the furthest distance the drone
	can detect, that is, \(50\) km \\
	\(tWCL\) & Threshold for \(WCL\) to determine how much SSA should be
	deployed. \\
