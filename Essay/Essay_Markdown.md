# Conquer The Flame



## Summary

Australia is undergoing huge wildfires in every state. To protect people and safety and property, we establish a model to use two types of drones to help Country Fire Authority (CFA) conduct “Rapid Bushfire Response”, and front-line personnel communicate with Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

We use `Victoria Fire Report Data`, using fire report places in certain time period to represent locations where fires happened on average. This allows us to take into account of factors such as fire size and frequency, economic cost and safety, weighted region area covered by drones. 

We set Fast Response Model for deployment of drones for fast response, we divide fire locations into clusters. There are two aspects we looked into, in-cluster relationship and relationship between clusters. For in-cluster relationship, according to the density of fire locations, we divide clusters into two types, dense cluster and sparse cluster. We establish separate models for each type of cluster. For dense cluster, we treated the cluster as a filled irregular region, and we establish Least Circles Maximum Coverage(LCMC) Model. For sparse cluster, we treat each fire location as node, and build edges for every node to form complete graph, and we build minimum spanning tree for it to ensure connectivity with lowest cost. For between-cluster relationship, we build edges between each cluster, and treat each cluster as a node. We ensure the connectivity by building minimum spanning tree.

We set Fire Prediction Model for second part of problem. we divide Victoria into several zones, and use statistics of zones in different time to form a time series. We predict the time series using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

We set Pearl Model and Spur Model for Deployment of drones for front-line personnel in different circumstances, we use separate deployment strategies for small and big sized fire considering the effect of terrain. 

The sensitivity analysis shows robustness in our model. Meanwhile, we combine all the models to finish the annotated Budget Request to help CFA with acceptable cost.

## Introduction

### Background

Wildfire spreads rapidly in Australia. In fire season, it's devastating for people's safety and properties. Victoria’s Country Fire Authority (CFA) uses different means to protect its people. Drones carrying high definition & thermal imaging cameras and telemetry sensors were sent for surveillance and situational awareness (SSA). Drone repeaters, transceivers that automatically rebroadcast signals at higher powers can help connect Emergency Operations Center (EOC) with SSA and front-line employees with VHF/UHF bands.

## Assumptions and Justifications

* We use one year data in Victoria with data provided by Earth Data to represent the general cases in Australia. However, our model to this case adapt to arbitrary cases, so it's without losing generality.
* We assume once the fire is within the detective range of drones, it will be found out without delay.
* We assume the spread rate of fire is stable and at a certain value, which is not the case in real world, but one can use the original formulae given in the model to simply modify the model.
* Only 20 years of data is used for machine learning, the error produced is within the acceptable range.
* The terrain situation can be more complicated in real world, we idealize mountain and other barriers as parabolic-like object.

## Fast Response Model

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Data Pre-processing ()



### Clustering ()
=======
To discuss the possible deployment of drones in order to detect fire and transmit the signal to EOC, we design Fast Response Model to maximize coverage and minimize the cost. To represent the fire distribution, fire frequency and fire size, we come up with several well-designed indices and use fire location in certain period to represent those factors with minimum lost of information.  Since it's not economically efficient to cover all the land of Victoria because the drones are able to move and the fact that fire can spread and then be detected, we use weighted covering lost(WCL) to represent the cost for not covering all the possible locations of fire. We use the data in 2020 for case study, but the strategy we adapt and the data we compute is generic and can be used in various situation. 

After sensitivity test, we proved the robustness of the model. It can be showed that the Fast Response Model can be used in different size of fire, different frequency of fire, and different distribution of fire in state of Victoria and other places in the world.

### Data Pre-processing (RH)

For the sake of CFA, our model should only be considering the fire situation within the range of state of Victoria. The data we obtained from NASA database is contains noise and locations out of border. The first step of data pre-processing is meant to sift out all the illegal point with criteria mentioned above. Considering the spatial location of noise point, we use DBSCAN clustering with ball tree[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_tree] algorithm, and is implemented by sci-learn project[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html#citing-scikit-learn]. Since the data contains latitude and longitude, to define the distance function for clustering one need to use the haversine formula["http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html"] to calculate the great-circle distance between two points.
$$
dist=2\cdot R_{e} \cdot \arctan (\sqrt{\frac {\sin^2(\frac {\Delta \varphi_{lat} }{2})+\cos\varphi _1\cdot 
\cos \varphi _2 \cdot \sin^2({ \frac {\Delta \lambda_{lon}} {2} })}
{1-(\sin^2(\frac {\Delta \varphi_{lat} }{2})+\cos\varphi _1\cdot 
\cos \varphi _2 \cdot \sin^2({ \frac {\Delta \lambda_{lon}} {2} }))}})
$$
This ensures the correctness of clustering.

To define a noise point which is inefficient to cover it, we define two variables $eps$ and $minPoints$​ according to DBSCAN conventions. 

To more easily obtain the optimized value, we first normalize data with standard normalization, then we set 
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{**lr**}
eps=0.15&  \\  
minPoints=8
\end{array}  
\right.
$$

### Deploying SSA 

To deploy drones in a way that reaches the target of fast response, we first need to quantify the target using one index, which we define it as weighted covering lost(WCL).
$$
WCL=\sum_j \int _{x0} ^{x1}  { (x-r_c)\cdot (1-p_{j,x})} \cdot vs_{j,x}  \  dx \\ \\
$$
To simplify our model, we assume $vs_{j,x}=v$, which is a stable value, then we have.
$$
WCL=\sum_j (\int _{x0} ^{x1}  { (x-r_c)\cdot p_{j,x}} \cdot  v  \  dx)^2
$$
In order to simply the model as well as simulate the distribution of $p_{j}$, we use Ridge Distribution to set $p_{j,x}$, which is the probability of rim of fire at the position which is $x$ km from the nearest SSA, as following
$$
p_{j,x}=\left\{
\begin{array}{**lr**}
\frac 1 2 - \frac 1 2 \sin \frac {\pi} {r_o}(x-\frac {r_o} {2} ) && 0\le x \le r_0 \\ 
0 && x > r_0
\end{array}  
\right.
$$
This gives us
$$
WCL=\sum_j (\int _{x0} ^{x1}  { (x-r_c)\cdot (\frac 1 2 + \frac 1 2 \sin \frac {\pi} {r_o}(x-\frac {r_o} {2} ))} \cdot  v  \  dx)^2
$$
We use the concept of substitution distance($sdist$) to investigate the deployment strategy.
$$
sdist=||\int _{x0} ^{x1}  { (x-r_c)\cdot (\frac 1 2 + \frac 1 2 \sin \frac {\pi} {r_o}(x-\frac {r_o} {2} ))} \cdot  v  \  dx||
$$
We define $sdist$ in a way that guarantees $sdist$ is positively correlated to $x$ which is the distance to the center, that is, the place where the nearest drone is deployed.

To balance economical costs and safety, we set a threshold for $WCL$, $tWCL$ which is currently set to a certain value in our later investigation, but it can be adjusted according to real situation. It will be illustrated more thoroughly in the following section about sensitivity and robustness. We use modified $k-means$ cluster to determine the positions of SSAs, which is described as follows

<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2022/02/11/gTmZnXOFjYIVMNi.png" alt="image-20220211181747899" style="zoom:67%;" />

This allows us to cluster the locations to their respective drones. k-means algorithm is used here since the $sdist$ is positively correlates to distance. So the correctness of the algorithm can be ensured.

Given the fire location distribution, we plot the SSA's location as follow. The range is marked as well. It can be observed that the fire is frequent and in large scale at the east of state of  Victoria. Our distribution perfectly fit the situation can reduce $WCL$ to acceptable level.
